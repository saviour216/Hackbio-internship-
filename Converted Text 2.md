**         Active site as a concept on drug discovery**

The concept of an active site is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, particularly in the development of cancer therapeutics (1). The active site refers to the region on an enzyme or receptor where a substrate or ligand binds, triggering a biological response (2). Understanding the active site is essential for designing effective drugs that can selectively target and modulate specific biological pathways.

In cancer, aberrant enzyme activity or altered receptor signaling can drive tumor growth and progression (3). Therefore, identifying and targeting the active sites of these enzymes or receptors can lead to the development of potent anticancer therapies. One approach is to design inhibitors that bind to the active site, blocking substrate access and enzyme activity. For example, the drug imatinib, used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, binds to the active site of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, inhibiting its activity and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells (4).

Another strategy is to develop activators that bind to the active site, enhancing enzyme activity or receptor signaling. This approach is exemplified by the drug lenalidomide, which binds to the active site of the cereblon enzyme, leading to the degradation of specific proteins involved in cancer cell survival (5).

The importance of active site targeting in drug discovery is underscored by the success of several cancer therapeutics. For instance, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib, which bind to the active site of EGFR, have shown significant efficacy in treating non-small cell lung cancer (6, 7). Similarly, the BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib, which targets the active site of the BRAF kinase, has demonstrated remarkable activity in treating melanoma (8).

Recent advances in structural biology and computational modeling have further enhanced our understanding of active sites, enabling the design of more selective and potent inhibitors (9). For example, the use of X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations has facilitated the development of covalent inhibitors, such as the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, which forms a covalent bond with the active site cysteine residue (10).

In conclusion, the concept of an active site is a cornerstone of drug discovery, particularly in the context of cancer therapeutics. By targeting the active sites of enzymes or receptors, researchers can develop potent and selective inhibitors or activators that modulate specific biological pathways, leading to effective treatments for cancer. Ongoing advances in structural biology and computational modeling will continue to facilitate the design of innovative therapeutics, underscoring the importance of active site targeting in the pursuit of improved cancer treatments.
